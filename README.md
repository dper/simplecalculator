# Simple Calculator

This is a simple JavaScript calculator.  There are several goals.

* **Small footprint**.  The entire calculator, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is a several-hundred line file.  It doesn't depend on external libraries.  You can copy that file, put it elsewhere, and as long as you have a web browser the calculator will work.

* **Easy to read**.  The code is quite simple.  Not only is the program very short, but it's also easy to understand.

* **Easy to modify**.  If you want to add a new function, you probably can with a little copy/paste work.  There are many great calculators already out there, but many have too many features.  If your target audience is confused by bells and whistles, one solution is to get rid of the extraneous bells and whistles.  By only including the functionality that you want, you make the calculator easy to use.
